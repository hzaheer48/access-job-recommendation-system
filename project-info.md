Technology Stack & Environment (Frontend details for implementation focus):

Frontend: React.js with Tailwind CSS for styling.

Backend: Django (Python) for API services, comprehensive data management, and core ML AI functionalities (including fine-tuning). All persistent data storage and user authentication will be handled entirely by the Django backend.

AI/ML: The React app will consume recommendation outputs and potentially other AI-driven data (e.g., skill suggestions, resume parsing results) from the Django backend's ML AI.

Development Environment: Trae IDE.

Core Functionalities & User Roles (Frontend Implementation Focus):

1. Job Seeker Module:

* **Authentication:**
    * User registration (via **simulated backend API call**).
    * User login (via **simulated backend API call**). The backend will conceptually handle user sessions and provide a user ID and role upon successful login.
* **Profile Management:**
    * Create and manage detailed user profiles (skills, education, experience, career preferences). This data will be sent to and retrieved from the **simulated Django backend**.
    * **Intelligent Resume Parsing & Profile Generation:** Allow job seekers to upload resumes (conceptual file upload UI). The frontend will simulate sending the file to the backend, which would then parse it to extract key information and pre-populate profile fields for user review and saving.
* **Job Searching & Filtering:**
    * Search for jobs by keywords, title, company, location, industry.
    * Apply comprehensive filters (e.g., salary range, job type, experience level, benefits, commute time - if data allows, all using **simulated backend data**).
    * Job data will be fetched from the **simulated Django backend**.
    * **Advanced Search Features:** Implement "Saved Searches" allowing users to save their search criteria (stored via **simulated backend API**).
* **Personalized Job Recommendations:**
    * Display AI-driven job recommendations. The recommendations will be fetched from the **simulated Django backend**, which conceptually integrates with the ML AI. The frontend is responsible for rendering these recommendations effectively.
    * **Explainable AI (XAI):** For each recommendation, display a brief, user-friendly explanation of *why* the job was recommended, based on data conceptually provided by the backend.
    * **User Feedback Loop:** Implement UI elements (e.g., "Like," "Dislike," "Not relevant") for job seekers to provide explicit feedback on recommendations. This feedback will be captured and sent to the **simulated backend for conceptual ML model fine-tuning**.
* **Skill Gap Analysis & Learning Path Suggestions:**
    * Based on the user's profile and desired job types, display conceptually identified skill gaps (data from **simulated backend ML**).
    * Provide conceptual suggestions for online courses or learning resources to bridge these gaps.
* **Job Alerts:**
    * Create and manage job alerts based on specific criteria (including saved search criteria).
    * Receive notifications for new matching jobs (frontend will display these based on **simulated backend alerts**).
    * Alert data will be managed via **simulated backend API calls**.
* **Application Tracking:**
    * Track the status of submitted job applications (e.g., applied, reviewed, interviewed, offered, rejected).
    * **Enhanced Application Workflow:** Allow users to conceptually attach custom cover letters per application (UI for upload/text input, **simulated backend storage**) and update specific interview stages.
    * Application data will be stored and retrieved via **simulated backend API calls**.
* **Job Bookmarking:**
    * Save interesting job listings for future reference.
    * Bookmark data will be managed via **simulated backend API calls**.
* **View Job Details:**
    * Ability to view comprehensive details of a selected job, fetched from the **simulated backend**.
    * **Rich Job Postings:** Job detail pages should display rich content (e.g., company logo, detailed benefits, short company description, conceptual links to internal company profiles).

2. Administrator Module:

* **Admin Authentication:**
    * Secure login for administrators (via **simulated backend API call**). The backend will conceptually verify admin credentials and provide an admin-specific user ID and role.
* **Dashboard:**
    * A concise dashboard displaying key system metrics.
    * **Comprehensive Analytics:** Expand dashboard to include detailed analytics such as total users, active jobs, top search queries, most applied-to job categories, and conceptual recommendation accuracy metrics (data from **simulated backend**).
* **Job Posting Management (CRUD):**
    * Add new job listings.
    * Update existing job details.
    * Delete job listings.
    * **Content Moderation:** Implement a conceptual system for admins to review and approve new job postings before they become visible to job seekers.
    * All job data will be managed via **simulated backend API calls**.
* **User Account Management (CRUD):**
    * View all user accounts (fetched from the **simulated backend**).
    * Approve new user registrations (if applicable, or simply manage existing roles/statuses).
    * Suspend or reactivate user accounts.
    * Delete user accounts.
    * **Crucially, display the full user ID (as conceptually provided by the backend) for all users in the admin view.**
    * All user management actions will be performed via **simulated backend API calls**.
* **System Activity Monitoring:**
    * (Conceptual for frontend) A dedicated section to display real-time system logs and activities from the **simulated backend**.
* **Recommendation Review & Fine-tuning:**
    * (Conceptual for frontend) A section where an admin can trigger fine-tuning processes for the ML model (**via simulated backend API calls**) and conceptually review ML model performance metrics.

Data Persistence & API Interaction Requirements (Frontend Perspective):

All application data (user profiles, jobs, alerts, applications, bookmarks, user data for admin, and authentication state) will be managed exclusively by the Django backend.

The React frontend will communicate with the backend via simulated RESTful API calls (using in-memory data within the frontend for this hackathon demo).

Data displayed in the UI will be fetched from the simulated backend.

Updates/deletions will send requests to the simulated backend, and the UI will reflect changes upon successful backend response (e.g., by re-fetching data).

There will be absolutely no interaction with any external database service from the frontend for any application data or authentication.

Data Sorting: Frontend will sort data in memory after receiving it from the backend; the conceptual backend will handle primary data ordering.

Complex Data Structures: The conceptual backend will handle serialization/deserialization for complex data structures (e.g., skills arrays, resume data); the frontend will send/receive standard JSON.

General Development Guidelines (Crucial for Hackathon Success):

Responsiveness: The application must be fully responsive across all device sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop) using Tailwind CSS responsive utilities. Optimal mobile usability is paramount.

User Experience (UX): Focus on a clean, intuitive, and visually appealing user interface. Prioritize ease of use and smooth navigation.

Code Quality: Write clean, modular, and well-commented React code. Use functional components and hooks. Ensure logical separation of concerns.

Robust Error Handling & User Feedback: Implement comprehensive try/catch blocks for all simulated backend API calls. Display specific, actionable error messages, success messages, and clear loading states via the custom modal component. Avoid silent failures.

No Native Alerts: Do not use alert(), confirm(), or prompt() under any circumstances. Always use the provided custom modal UI for confirmations, warnings, or informational messages.

Completeness & Polish: Provide complete and runnable code. Avoid ... or incomplete sections. The UI should look polished and professional.

Performance Optimization: Implement strategies for fast loading times, such as efficient data fetching and rendering. Consider pagination or infinite scrolling for lists of jobs/users if data sets grow large (even conceptually).

Scalability Considerations (for discussion/design): Be prepared to discuss how the chosen tech stack (React, Django, Python ML) is designed to scale horizontally to handle a growing number of users and job listings in a real-world scenario.

Security Best Practices (for discussion/design): Emphasize key security measures in your design, such as proper input validation on both frontend and backend, secure handling of API keys, and considerations for data encryption in transit and at rest.
