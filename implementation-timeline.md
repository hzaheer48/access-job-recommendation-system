Access Job Recommendation System: Hackathon Implementation Timeline
This timeline outlines a phased approach for developing the "Access Job Recommendation System" within a typical hackathon timeframe (e.g., 24-48 hours). It focuses on achieving a functional prototype with key features.

Phase 1: Planning & Setup (Approx. 2-4 hours)
Goal: Establish project foundation, confirm tech stack, and get basic environments running.

Primary Owners: @Mirza Abdullah Tariq (Coordination), @नेपाली बाबु (Backend), @betty (Frontend), @Chon Ming (Full-stack support)

Tasks:

Finalize detailed feature list and prioritize MVP (Minimum Viable Product).

Initialize GitHub repository and establish core directory structure.

Set up Python virtual environment for backend.

Install Django, Django REST Framework.

Initialize Django project and basic apps (e.g., users, jobs).

Set up React project in frontend/ (e.g., create-react-app).

Install and configure Tailwind CSS.

Create initial README.md and .gitignore.

Confirm both frontend (React) and backend (Django conceptual APIs) can run independently.

Deliverables:

Project repository with basic structure.

Runnable (empty) React frontend.

Runnable (empty) Django project.

Shared simulatedBackendData structure in frontend.

Phase 2: Core Backend Development & Simulated API Layer (Approx. 6-8 hours)
Goal: Develop the conceptual backend API endpoints and the simulatedBackendApi in the frontend to allow independent frontend development. This is crucial as actual backend might be slower.

Primary Owners: @नेपाली बाबु, @~Senorita (Backend Logic), @Chon Ming (API definition/mocking)

Tasks:

Define comprehensive API routes for all CRUD operations for Jobs, User Profiles, Alerts, Applications, Bookmarks, and User Management.

Implement the simulatedBackendApi object in the frontend to mock all these backend calls using in-memory data (simulatedBackendData).

Develop placeholder logic within these simulated APIs for basic data manipulation (add, edit, delete, fetch).

Conceptualize backend authentication flow (mocking JWT/session return).

Deliverables:

Complete simulatedBackendApi integrated into the frontend.

Initial conceptual data in simulatedBackendData.

Clear API contract (endpoints, request/response formats) defined.

Phase 3: Core Frontend Development - Job Seeker Module (Approx. 8-12 hours)
Goal: Implement the essential job seeker functionalities.

Primary Owners: @betty, @Chon Ming

Tasks:

Develop shared UI components (Modal, Header, Footer).

Build Login and Registration forms, integrating with simulated backend authentication.

Create Job Seeker Dashboard with navigation.

Implement Profile Management UI (create/edit), fetching/saving data via simulated backend API.

Develop Job Search and Filter UI.

Display job listings fetched from simulated backend jobs API.

Implement "View Job Details" modal.

Set up Personalized Recommendations section (displaying conceptual data from simulated backend).

Implement Job Alerts UI (add/delete conceptual alerts).

Implement Application Tracking UI (display, conceptual status update).

Implement Job Bookmarking UI (add/delete conceptual bookmarks).

Deliverables:

Functional login/registration.

Job seeker dashboard with clickable navigation.

Basic profile management.

Searchable/filterable job listings.

Placeholder sections for AI features (recommendations, skill gap).

Functional job alerts, application tracking, and bookmarking (all with simulated data).

Phase 4: Frontend Development - Administrator Module & Feature Enhancements (Approx. 6-10 hours)
Goal: Implement core admin functionalities and integrate selected enhanced features.

Primary Owners: @Chon Ming, @betty

Tasks:

Create Admin Dashboard with navigation.

Implement Dashboard Overview (displaying conceptual metrics from simulated backend).

Build Job Posting Management UI (add, edit, delete jobs via simulated backend API).

Develop User Account Management UI (view, suspend/resume, delete users via simulated backend API; display full user ID).

Conceptual Resume Parsing UI: Add upload field, display message that it would pre-populate.

XAI UI: Add placeholder text for "why recommended" on job recommendations.

User Feedback Loop UI: Add simple buttons (Like/Dislike) on recommendations for conceptual feedback.

Conceptual Skill Gap Analysis & Learning Paths: Add a section showing mock skill gaps and conceptual learning suggestions.

Conceptual Content Moderation UI: Add a visual indicator (e.g., "Pending Approval") for new jobs.

Conceptual System Activity Monitoring: Display static mock logs.

Conceptual Recommendation Review & Fine-tuning: Add a button/indicator for triggering fine-tuning.

Deliverables:

Functional admin dashboard.

Job and user management.

UI for selected advanced features (Resume Parsing, XAI, Feedback, Skill Gaps, Content Moderation, Analytics, Fine-tuning).

Phase 5: Integration, Testing & Polish (Approx. 2-4 hours)
Goal: Ensure a cohesive, polished, and robust presentation-ready application.

Primary Owners: @Mirza Abdullah Tariq (Testing & PM), All (Bug Fixing, Refinement)

Tasks:

Full Functional Testing: Run through all user flows (job seeker, admin).

Responsiveness Testing: Verify display across various devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).

Error Handling Testing: Trigger simulated errors to ensure modals work correctly.

Code Review: Final pass for cleanliness, comments, and adherence to guidelines.

UI/UX Polish: Refine styling, transitions, and overall visual appeal using Tailwind CSS.

Update README.md with final features and instructions for presentation.

Prepare presentation/demo script, focusing on key AI features and user benefits.

Deliverables:

A fully functional, polished hackathon prototype.

Minimal bugs.

Compelling demo.

Well-documented code and project.

This timeline provides a structured approach, allowing you to track progress and assign responsibilities effectively. Remember to stay flexible and adapt as needed during the hackathon!
